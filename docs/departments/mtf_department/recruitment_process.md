The Mobile Task Forces is reasonably, a very difficult department to get into. Recruiting only the best of the best, who can perform their duties to the highest degree, handling whatever situation is set out in front of them, which is why the recruitment process is so tedious.

Tryouts first start with an announcement in the main discord, which marks the opening of applications. Applications remain open for 72 hours, and within this 72 hours MTF Sergeant+ should be actively looking through and accepting applications, and inviting them to the Recruitment Grounds discord.

After applications close, itâ€™s expected that there will be around ~150-200 tryoutees, depending on how many people wanted to try out this time around. Tryouts will be held on a signle day, decided by popular vote.

:::caution
If you fail a single evaluation, you will be kicked from tryouts as a whole. This is to lower the amount of people tryouting, and makes it easier for the command to see who performed the greatest.

:::note
After the conclusion of the tryout, MTF command will decided who has passed based on an indepth grading system.
