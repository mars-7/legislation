Quality Assurance is a huge component of the Manufacturing Department and is designated to test projects before their release as well as seek out bugs post-release. Quality Assurance Personnel are not considered essential personnel within the Manufacturing Department and as such are not given any special leniency in regards to Foundation legislature.

Quality Assurance Personnel are subject to any and all Foundation legislature and unless specifically stated otherwise in Universal Privileges or QA Privileges must act as if, and be treated as if they were on the Foundation Team.
