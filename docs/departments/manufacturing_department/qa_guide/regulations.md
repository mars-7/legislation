All members of the Quality Assurance Team are to obey and abide by the regulations and guides displayed below. Failure to do so, will not only degrade the quality of the game, but will also result in disciplinary action by the Quality Assurance Coordinator, the TID, or any member of Overwatch Command.

- You are to display respect to all personnel, regardless of rank or authority. 

- You are to abide by all regulations explicitly stated within the Supreme Guidelines, unless stated otherwise within this document.

- You are to display requisite levels of maturity, competence, and dedication, while on the Manufacturing Department Team.

- When a member of the Development Team, or EC requests you to cease any activities you pursue, you are to stop without hesitation. 

- You are to not share ANY information within the Discord Server, Staging or Dev games without explicit permission from **MaD oversight**. Doing so is grounds for an immediate Foundation Blacklist. 

- You are to not interfere with onsite operations, unless strictly given permission by **MaD Oversight**.

- You are not to utilize the MaD team to evade Solitary Confinement.

- You are not to enter the **Pathos - III Dev** game, unless testing an addressed bug, or if requested by development staff. You may enter Staging at any time to test.

- If you are unsure if you can do something or not, assume you cannot, and ask questions later.

- You are only permitted to QA test on private servers unless explicitly given permission by **Manufacturing Secretary** or above.

- You are to follow the Foundation Legal Code and Supreme Guidelines in full.
