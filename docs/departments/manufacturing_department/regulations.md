## Communications with the Community

Developers and the community have had a spotted past in regards to communications. It is our job to represent the community views on updates and features fairly, and balance this against our goals and visions for the game.

When communicating with the community, you should remain respectful regardless of the respect from the other side. If the conversation is too heated, you should call a Moderator and then **stop discussing**. It is better that they handle it than you risk starting / becoming involved in an argument.

The Nolt is the primary way that we gather feedback externally. You should refer people to the Nolt for bug reports and feature requests rather than taking them personally. You should *not* promise features, bug fixes, or time estimates of in progress work to users unless you have cleared it through the **Technical Installation Director** or above.

:::caution Inappropriate Behavior
The community places its trust in MaD to deliver features fairly and based on needs, not on personal views or vendettas. The following are examples of inappropriate behavior:

- Threatening to de-prioritise or stop work on a bug fix, feature or other work in public because of a disagreement with community members
- Voicing abusive / highly negative opinions of anyone, including other developers publicly or in official Manufacturing Department channels
- Threatening community members with retribution of any kind (particularly through use of MaD perks) or using perks to disrupt site activities
- Engaging in heated, prolonged arguments in public channels with community members

This kind of behavior, depending on circumstance, history and severity will warrant either suspension or immediate termination.

## Development Secrecy

Developers are expected to keep future updates confidential to protect our intellectual property and keep our updates unique and special. This also reduces pressure to deliver specific content if it becomes impossible to deliver it.

Not all work or projects is kept confidential, though. Developers should use their best judgement to decide what information to disclose, but it is better to be *safe than sorry*. Discuss any concerns with your area lead (Senior Developer for your area) before disclosing it to someone.

Examples of appropriate disclosures are:
- The fact that you are engaging with, or working actively on a bug fix for something;
- A minor feature or change (the kind that doesn't need approval from MaD oversight);
- Discussing the possibility of a change (i.e. "We should do X")

Examples of **inappropriate** disclosures are:
- Disclosing any information you know (or should know) is confidential;
- Disclosing screenshots, videos or recordings of work without permission;
- Disclosing sensitive keys, credentials or information;
- Disclosing any information that you have been provided as part of your duties in MaD in confidence (i.e. departmental guidelines, etc.);
- Revealing the internal workings of SCPs, or what SCPs are being worked on;
- Disclosing anything that would be detrimental to game security

:::info IP Rights
Once developers give assets to the Manufacturing Department, as long as they receive the agreed compensation for those assets (this can be no compensation, if agreed in advance to be so - although we typically pay for any development work) that work is irrevocably provided to the group unless otherwise agreed on beforehand by the Manufacturing Department Overseer.

It is recommended that you agree prices for work with your project manager *before* beginning it / sending it so that we can agree on a mutually acceptable price in a productive manner.
