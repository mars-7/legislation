:::caution
These privileges are **not a right** - any and all of them can be taken away, at any time. Whilst you will always be able to do what is necessary for your job, abuse of these privileges will lead to their suspension or removal.

## Developer Console

Any developer who has access to the server side command console may run code as needed, but should be sensible whilst doing this.

- Do **NOT** run code you do not personally understand (or didn't write yourself). This poses a danger to the game.
- Do **NOT** use the command bar to give yourself additional privileges or bypass the admin guidelines laid out above.
