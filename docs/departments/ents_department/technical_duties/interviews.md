Interviews are a method of communication between E&TS members and the community. The types of interviews are described below. 

- Inspection + Interview
- CDC Interview
- SCP-457 Interview
- Cross Interview
- SCP Demonstration Interview
- Performance Analysis

When adding an interview to an Inspection, you may have a maximum of 1 accompanied with it. Interviews may only be done every 2 hours. If ever an individual submits another interview within the time period, the second one submitted may be marked as invalid. Interviews attached to inspections may be an interview of any personnel on site, as long as it relates to the inspection. Interviews attached to inspections lose 1 promotion credit in value.

- **Technical Apprentices may perform Performance Analysis, Interviews on inspections, CDC interviews, and cross interviews, with Senior Engineer+ supervision or approval**. 
- SCP Demonstration interviews require Senior Engineer approval if you are a Junior Engineer. 
- Cross Interviews require approval from a Technician if you are a Junior Engineer or an Engineer. 

Interviews are to be logged word for word and are to contain a summary paragraph or two after the interview, to depict issues and possible resolutions.

### Class-D Interviews

Members ranked Junior Engineer+ may freely host interviews with Class-D personnel. It is to note you are never allowed to enter the CDCZ, but you may request them to the interview room to interview them. You may only interview up to 2 Class-Ds at a time. Do so by saying the following:

**“Requesting [#] CD(s) to the interview room.”**



A special type of inside-CDC interview can be hosted by Senior Engineers (with Senior Technician permission) (as an individual), or Technicians (as a rally), where E&Ts members gather inside the CDC. Once it’s lockup, E&Ts personnel will be allowed inside the CDC under SD escort, a minimum of 1 per E&TS entering. During this time, the host will request a maximum of 10 D-Class personnel, who will be escorted into the outer CDC where E&Ts personnel are present. From there, E&Ts personnel will be able to interview the Class-D’s in order to get their opinions on any topic they’d like to ask. It’s important to keep questions relevant, and these can be used to get ideas from Class-D’s on inspections.

### SCP-457 Interview Procedures

:::note
In order to commence an SCP-457 interview, you must first obtain 3-4 Class D Personnel. Given you are utilizing Class D personnel, an additional Security Department escort is required.
:::

The following are procedures for obtaining Class D Personnel.

1. Head to the CDCZ.
2. Announce on the radio, “Requesting 3-4 CDs for an SCP - 457 interviews.” (or anything along those lines.)
3. Head to SCP - 457’s chamber with your required escorts.
4. Brief the Class-Ds about their current assignment. Instruct them to move to the middle of the room once inside the chamber.
5. Open the outer briefing gate, and have 2-3 out of the 3-4 Class Ds stand inside. Then close the outer gate, open the inner gate, then close the inner gate once the CDs are out of the airlock.

Once SCP - 457 is properly fueled and able to communicate, the interview may commence. It is to note that SCP - 457 loses fuel over time, so make sure to interview quickly yet effectively. If 457’s speech starts to become sluggish once more, perform steps 5 and 6 with the remaining CD. Once the interview is over, take any surviving Class-D back to the CDCZ (extras and anything of the sort) and have your escorts take you out of Epsilon. Once it is done, you must log the recorded responses.
