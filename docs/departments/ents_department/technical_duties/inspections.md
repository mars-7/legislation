Inspections are to be carried out on the installation’s infrastructure, as a way to identify areas which might need improvement or you simply find interest in. Inspections are a way for members of E&Ts to outlet their creativity and critical thinking skills while benefiting the Foundation through their content. Your goal should be trying to challenge yourself with these works, in an attempt to learn more and develop your skills.

**Inspections** can be done in any area, though you’ll also be able to perform them on SCP chambers inside Epsilon and the Cleanrooms. Regulations are found below. 

- You may enter the SCP’s containment chamber, only if you are entering the cell for Clean Rooms SCPs and 082. You may not enter the cell of any other SCP.
- You may also ask to spectate ScD/MD tests to inspect containment zones.
- If your inspection contains an interview, you must write the transcript. 
- If your inspection includes an interview, you get the combined total of both articles of work.
- To inspect a restricted area, (such as EC spawn) you must inform the Middle Command or higher of the associated department, and request their approval.

### Writing Inspections

As inspections are a requirement to move forward in E&Ts, it is a necessity to understand how they work. When starting with an inspection, you’ll first need to decide a place to inspect. Your goal should be to choose a place that you find to be interesting, making sure it isn’t too small yet isn’t too big either. An example of something in the middle would be around the size of the Ethics Committee spawn, and while you can inspect places of any size, it’s recommended to choose a medium size as you start your career. In general, it’s safer to have a broader room rather than narrowing it down into simply one room. Try to choose an inspection target that encompasses all relevant areas. 

From there, you’ll want to survey the entire area, taking pictures of the landscape and any areas you find of importance. In the first part of your inspection, you’ll want to talk about the area from an analytical view. You should talk about its purpose, its structure, or even its layout. You should then move into the suggestions part, where you isolate certain things inside your area and talk about ways you can improve, replace, delete, or move structures. Once you have one of these suggestions to improve the area, explain why it would improve the area and how people could interact with it. It’s important to have a good amount of suggestions, both big and small.

- Engineering personnel may request for a maximum amount of 2 Class-Ds when performing an inspection on Subject-8871 and SCP-610’s containment. If you opt to utilize Class-Ds, ask them to enter the containment of any of the SCP or entities mentioned above, then ask them to provide a description of what the area looks like.

- Engineering personnel may enter the containment of the SCP if permitted by any Crimson-9 escort.

:::info
You are however not permitted to enter the inner-containment of SCP-610, Subject-8871 and Subject-0666.
