Oftentimes, duties involving personnel or singular SCPs can get repetitive after a while, leaving no room for unique and different experiences, causing personnel to rapidly lose motivation when conducting interviews. As such, Cross Interviews are another one of the numerous activities participants within E&TS can perform.

A cross interview is a method to get a second opinion on a containment chamber or general containment measures revolving around SCPs or other infrastructure. When performing a Cross Interview, you need to decide your region/SCP of focus, whether it be another area within the Site, or another SCP and its containment. 

The following table is a list of escorts required for each category of Cross Interviews.

| SCPs Involved | Escorts Required |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 Sentient Passive SCP (131, 368, 999, 1048-G) | 1 SD (+1 MTF C9 [Replaceable] if in Epsilon) |
| 1 Sentient Neutral SCP (049, 082, 662, 1048)| 1 MTF Crimson 9 (Replaceable) 1 SD. 049 has a required C9. |
| 1 Sentient Passive or Neutral SCP, 1 Non-Sentient SCP | 1 MTF Crimson 9 (Replaceable), 1 SD |
| 2 Sentient Passive/Neutral SCPs | 1 MTF Crimson 9 (Not Replaceable), 1 SD |

:::note
A Crimson 9 can be replaced by another MTF, SRU, or MP if no C9 responds after a measure of time.

As soon as you have acquired the requisite escorts, you are to first head to the Sentient or Neutral SCP. Passive and Neutral SCPs include SCP-131, SCP-368, SCP-999, SCP-662, SCP-049, SCP-082, and SCP-1048. 

Instruct the SCP to follow you to your area of focus next. This next section will be split into 3 categories, depending on if, and if so, what kind of SCP is withincan or is, the Area of Focus.
	
If the area is purely infrastructure and does not involve any anomalies, then you are permitted to walk with your escorts and the SCP to the Area of Focus, no further steps are required. Remember, if it is a restricted area, you are required to bring an extra escort and get said escorts’ permission. From there, ask the sentient SCP to look around, then ask their opinions. It is also recommended to ask questions such as major issues or possible fixes.

If the area involves a non-sentient SCP, such as in the Bio-Containment Zone, or within the Clean Rooms, you are to head to the Area of Focus. If the Area of Focus is an SCP within the Clean Rooms, you are to instruct an escort to pick up the box, and bring it to one of the “Testing Chambers”. You will ask the sentient SCP accompanying you to enter the chamber, look at the SCP, and interact only if they wish. After a minute or so, ask them to exit the chamber, then give them a brief about what the non-sentient SCP can do. From there, ask the sentient SCP their opinions on the infrastructure and the likes. It is also recommended to ask questions such as major issues or possible fixes.

If the area involves another sentient SCP, you are to head to that Area of Focus, while escorting the other SCP. For simplicity reasons, the SCP being interviewed will be designated SCP 1, while the other will be designated SCP 2. Ask SCP 1 to enter SCP 2’s chamber, look around, and interact with SCP 2. Instruct SCP 1 to ask questions to SCP 2 to form a more complete opinion on the chamber and what could be added. From there, ask SCP 1 their opinions on the infrastructure and the likes, along with the satisfaction of SCP 2. It is also recommended to ask questions such as major issues or possible fixes. You may repeat this with SCP 1 being SCP 2 and vice versa.

Upon the conclusion of the interview, you are to write up a log with everything that you learned, along with a Q&A log area. You are to utilize what you observed to institute solutions to issues discovered.
