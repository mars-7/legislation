Performance Analysis is a way of learning more about the unique duties that different individuals perform on a normal basis in order to come up with solutions that may help them perform their duties efficiently.

Engineering personnel at the rank of Junior Engineer may perform Performance Analysis without the need for any permission or supervision. Technical Apprentices too may perform this kind of interview, although they would need permission from a Technician and the supervision of an Engineer while doing so.

Below are the step-by-step instructions on how to perform an inspection. 

- **STEP 1:** The first step in performing a Performance Analysis would be to approach an individual you wish to perform this activity on, then ask their permission if you can watch them go through their daily duties for 5 minutes.

:::note
Engineering personnel are not permitted to perform Performance Analysis on members of the DIA, along with the EC and the MP if they are dealing with rogue personnel.
:::

- **STEP 2:** Now that the individual has granted you the authorization of you being able to follow them for 5 minutes, follow them and log all of their actions on your document.

:::note
You may not follow them into restricted areas unless you have gathered the requisite approvals and escorts while inside.

If you are unable to gather the proper escorts or the approvals needed, then wait for them to exit the area, then ask them as to what they did while you weren’t able to view them.
:::

- **STEP 3:** After having been following the individual for 5 minutes straight, you are then to ask them questions related to the issues they have encountered during the Performance Analysis, along with questions asking for suggestions that may help improve their experience when performing their duties.

- **STEP 4:** The next step in performing this type of activity would be to then formulate short-term solutions which you believe may help solve any issues that the individual on which you are performing a Performance Analysis. These short-term solutions shouldn’t break any important regulations set.

:::note
These short-term solutions shouldn’t require any help from the MaD. An example of a short-term solution would be to have a member of the MD follow combative personnel when clearing the site of any escaped Class-D personnel.
:::

- **STEP 5:** With the short-term solutions ready, ask the individual whom you are performing a Performance Analysis to perform the short-term solutions that you have come up with for 5 minutes, then log all events that occurred while it was being performed. Remember to log any positive and negative changes that occurred.

:::note
You may ask other personnel to partake in it if it involves the participation of 1 or more individuals, however, these individuals may not be used as an excuse to perform unethical activities [Ex: Using SC-0s as “meat shields”]
:::

**STEP 6:** The last step in performing a Performance Analysis would be to come up with long-term solutions. Examples of long-term solutions may be adding more walls into the Phi Cafeteria to allow Foundation personnel to take cover from any bullets should a shootout occur within the cafeteria.

Performance Analyses are graded based on how detailed you described the events that occurred whilst performing this activity, the suggestions you have provided, and the uniqueness of the suggestions and interview questions you have provided. The highest grade you can get in all categories is Excellence, while the lowest grade you can get is unsatisfactory.
