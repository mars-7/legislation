SCP Demonstration interviews are a method of understanding the functions and limits of sentient anomalies within the foundation. You are able to conduct SCP Demonstration Interviews once you are the rank of Junior Engineer. You do require approval from a Senior Engineer, or Technician, before doing so. If you  are the rank of Engineer, if you do not possess the requirement to seek approval. For each SCP Demonstration Interview, you will require 1-3 Class D Personnel. Junior Engineers may only utilize a maximum of 2 Class D Personnel, Engineers may utilize a maximum of 3 Class D Personnel. You require one SD escort for every 2 Class D. **SCP-999, SCP-131, SCP-368, and SCP-1048** (Main Bear), do not require Class D, although you may utilize them if you desire.

To host an SCP Demonstration Interview, you are to begin by conducting a standard interview on the anomaly. A reminder that these questions should be based on the chamber, and other areas that concern Engineering and Technical Services. You are to ask a minimum of 3 questions, although it is preferred to keep that number at around 5. Upon the conclusion of the questions, you are to then commence the SCP Demonstration. The table below will depict SCP Demonstrations, and their required escorts.

| SCP | Additional Escorts Required | Demonstration |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 999 | 1 SRU / MP / MTF | Instruct the Class D Personnel to play with SCP-999 for approximately 3 minutes. |
| 131 | 1 SRU / MP / MTF | Instruct the Class D Personnel to play with SCP-131 for approximately 3 minutes, utilize some racing activities. |
| 368 | 1 SRU / MP / MTF | Instruct the Class D Personnel to position themselves around the room to form an obstacle course for SCP-368. |
| 1048 | 1 SRU / MP / MTF (If no instances), or 1 C9 / MTF (If instances) | Instruct the Class D Personnel to request for drawings by SCP-1048. Alternatively, you could instruct the Class D Personnel to request for a specific instance, to then interact with. |
| 049 | 1 C9, or 2 SRU / MP / MTF | Tell SCP-049 that the given Class D will be his subjects to utilize, permit SCP-049 to wander towards the clean rooms if they request, provided they have an escort. |
| 082 | 1 C9, or 1 SRU / MP / MTF | Instruct the Class D personnel to offer themselves to SCP-082 for games, for consuming, or for other reasons. You may decide upon a specific request as well. |
| 457 | 1-2 C9 | Instruct SCP-457 to utilize its abilities upon the Class D. Incentivize them with fuel. As such, do not use all Class D personnel for the actual demonstration. |

Upon the conclusion of the SCP Demonstration, you are to ask the SCP one final question. **This question is to hear the requests of the SCP, to make a demonstration with the same scenario, more enjoyable for it. You are to also ask the Class D for suggestions.** Interview, you are to write up an interview log, including the questions and the answers received. In addition, you are to write a summary regarding your discoveries, and how to alter the chamber and/or other areas of the foundation around said discoveries. As an example, if SCP-131 kept running around in a small area for a race, one of your possible suggestions could be to increase the size of the room.
