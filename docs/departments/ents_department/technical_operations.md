### Technical Wing Operations

The Technical Wing Appliances, along with the Dark Matter Reactor, are responsible for the production of electricity throughout the installation. The Technical Wing Appliances consists of turbines, generators and transformers. All of the aforementioned appliances may be located within the lowest level of the Technical Wing.

Engineering personnel, regardless of rank, are all responsible for ensuring that the aforementioned appliances are always well-maintained and operational to prevent any blackouts from occurring. Members of the department are given resources and abilities to prevent this kind of event from happening, such as the ability to request for parts to be delivered to a member by the LD, to be able to utilise Class-Ds for appliance repairs.

The Technical Wing Operations Handbook may be accessed by all members of the Engineering & Technical Services Department.

### Reactor Operations

The Dark Matter Reactor is the prime energy source for the installation, albeit an unstable one. Given its complex controls and mechanisms, requisite handling and care is to be utilized at all times while maintaining the reactor. 

Engineering and Technical Services will be responsible for the maintenance of the reactor, utilizing Class D Personnel and a variety of other resources in order to ensure the general stability of the power granted to the facility. Mobile Task Forces Crimson-9 will be responsible for ensuring the safety of all E&TS Personnel assigned to operate the Dark Matter Reactor.

The Reactor Operations Handbook may be accessed by all members of the Engineering & Technical Services Department and MTF Crimson-9.
