Interviews are a method of communication between E&TS members and the community. They allow members of the department to know more about the opinions of members of the Foundation and SCPs regarding the installation’s infrastructure. 

Engineering personnel at the rank of Technical Apprentice are permitted to perform standard interviews [interviews conducted on FP] without any permission or supervision and may begin performing the other types of interviews at the rank of Junior Engineer.

Below is a list of the types of interviews engineering personnel may perform.

- Standard Interviews
- Class-D Interviews
- SCP Demonstration Interviews
- Cross Interviews
- SCP-457 Interviews

Interviews are graded based on how detailed you described the area, the suggestions you have provided, and the uniqueness of the suggestions and interview questions you have provided. The highest grade you can get in all categories is Excellence, while the lowest grade you can get is unsatisfactory.
:::

|Grade|Detail|Suggestions|Creativity|
|-------|------------|-----------|----------|
|Excellence|All responses provided by the interviewee were logged word for word. A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the interviewee’s responses, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was provided and written with a great amount of detail.|Suggestions explicitly address issues that have been identified. At least half of the ideas deliver a significant advantage without radically affecting the Foundation's operations or imposing negative consequences.|Over half of the questions asked during the interview were very specific, original and distinguished. The suggestions/solutions provided were all unique.|
|Well Done|All responses provided by the interviewee were logged word for word. A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the interviewee’s responses, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was provided and written with a good amount of detail.|At least half of the ideas explicitly address concerns that have already been written within the same document. At least half of the solutions deliver significant advantages without putting a significant strain on the Foundation's operations. The alternative methods either bring benefits that aren't very significant, or they have drawbacks.|At least half of the questions asked during the interview were very specific, original and distinguished. The suggestions/solutions provided may have been mentioned before, however, it doesn’t fall within the common category.|
|Satisfactory|Most responses provided by the interviewee were logged word for word. A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the interviewee’s responses, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was provided and written in a vague amount of detail.|At least one suggestion explicitly resolves a problem that has been reported in the same document or report as the first one. Although at least one of the recommendations has moderate to high advantages, it also has some big negatives. Solutions and ideas are presented in a manner that is consistent with E&TS's operations. Suggestions were described with a vague amount of detail.|At least half of the questions asked during the interview were specific, original and distinguished. The suggestions/solutions provided may have been mentioned before, and are considered to be somewhat common.|
|Needs Improvement|Most responses provided by the interviewee were logged word for word. A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the interviewee’s responses, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was not provided.|None of the solutions directly address a problem that has been identified in the paper. The solutions either do not give any benefits or have severe disadvantages.|At least one question asked during the interview was specific, original and distinguished. The suggestions/solutions provided may have been mentioned before, and are considered to be common.|
|Unsatisfactory|Does not fit into any of the categories above.|Does not fit into any of the categories above.|Does not fit into any of the categories above.

Each of those category grades [Excellence, Well, Done, Satisfactory, etc.] are worth points to help in calculating your overall grade.

|Category Grade|Points Worth|
|-------|-------|
|Excellence|5 Points|
|Well Done|3 Points|
|Satisfactory|2 Points|
|Needs Improvement|1 Point|
|Unsatisfactory|0 Points|

### Standard Interviews

Interviews or standard interviews are a way of gathering opinions of other individuals regarding the infrastructure of a certain area. Interviews may be attached to Performance Analysis and Inspections to receive more promotion credits, however, the number of promotion credits you would receive by doing so would be decreased by 1.

Below are the step-by-step instructions on how to perform a standard interview.

- **STEP 1:** The first step when performing an interview would be to first formulate questions that you will be asking the interviewee. These questions should be related to the infrastructure or furnishing of an area. Examples of questions that you would want to ask an interviewee would be “What are your opinions on the colour of the room.” and “Do you think that another vending machine should be added to this room? Why or why not?”. It is advised that you think of 4-7 questions for your interview.

- **STEP 2:** After you have your questions for the interview ready, approach a member of the Foundation you wish to interview. Technical Apprentices may perform interviews on SCPs roaming around the installation with the supervision of an Engineer. Anyone at the rank of Junior Engineer or above, however, doesn’t need any supervision or permission.
> When performing a Class-D interview, you may instead head to the Class-D visitation centre and ask for a member of the SD to bring a Class-D to the area for you to interview.

- **STEP 3:** Now that you have found an individual or an SCP that you want to interview, first ask them if they wish to partake in your interview. If not, then you are free to ask another individual to interview [If you were planning on interviewing an SCP and they refuse to be interviewed, ask them for a time they are available for one instead] If they do agree, then begin asking them the questions you have thought of earlier. Remember to log all responses in a document.

- **STEP 4:** With all of the responses you have gathered during the interview, formulate solutions that may satisfy the wants of the interviewee. If the interview mentioned in the interview that the area was too dim, then you may write down on your document that more lights should be added to the area. Ensure that all solutions written on the document are described in great detail.

Interviews may be submitted using the E&TS Document Submissions Form.

### Class-D Interviews

Class-D Interviews are a way of getting the opinions and suggestions of Class-D personnel on the Class-D Cells to compose solutions that may help enhance their overall enjoyment and comfortability whilst within their designated living space.

Engineering personnel at the rank of Junior Engineer may perform interviews on Class-Ds without the need for any permission or supervision. Technical Apprentices too may perform this kind of interview, although they would need permission from a Technician and the supervision of an Engineer while doing so.

Class-D interviews are to be performed within the Class-D visitation centre which may be found in the lower observation area

As the keycards issued to engineering personnel don't allow them to enter the area, you will have to ask a member of the Security Department to take you there.

Upon arrival at the visitation centre, you may ask a member of the SD to take a Class-D to the visitation centre for you to interview. You may begin your interview as soon as the Class-D is ready.

Information regarding interviews, along with instructions on how to perform them may be found in the Standard Interviews section of this document.

### CDC Interviews

CDC Interviews are similar to Class-D interviews, albeit this type of interview is performed while inside of the Class-D Containment area itself.

Engineering personnel at the rank of Senior Engineer may request the approval of a Technician to perform this. Those below the rank of Senior Engineer too may perform this activity during a rally hosted by a Technician.

CDC interviews may only be performed for the duration of the lockup and sleep period, so it is advised that you head to the lower observation area three [3] minutes prior to the lockup period starting to make the most of the short time given.

Engineering personnel may reside in the area with tables and chairs near the observation area. The host may request for a maximum amount of ten [10] Class-Ds.

Class-D Interviews may be submitted using the E&TS Document Submissions Form.

### SCP Demonstration Interviews

SCP Demonstration interviews are a method of understanding the functions and limits of sentient SCPs within the foundation.

The following table shows a list of the SCPs in which SCP Demonstrations may be performed, the number of Class-Ds you are permitted to use, how many escorts you would need for it, and the required permission and/or supervision you must acquire before you perform this type of interview.

|SCP|Number of CDs Permitted|Additional Escorts Required|Requirements|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|SCP-999, SCP-131, SCP-368|[OPTIONAL] Junior Engineer: 1-2 CDs Engineer+: 1-3 CDs|1 C-9 / 1 MTF [or if none on-site] MP / SRU / SD|TA with EN supervision and TC approval, JE with TC approval, EN|
|SCP-049, SCP-082|Junior Engineer: 1-2 CDs Engineer+: 1-3 CDs|1 C-9 / 1 MTF [or if none on-site] MP / SRU / SD|TA with EN supervision and TC approval, JE with TC approval, EN|
|SCP-1048|[OPTIONAL IF IT’S THE MAIN BEAR] Junior Engineer: 1-2 CDs Engineer+: 1-3 CDs|1 C-9 / 1 MTF [or if none on-site] MP / SRU / SD [If it’s a 1048 instance, an MTF escort is required]|TA with EN supervision and TC approval, JE with TC approval, EN|
|SCP-457|8 CDs|1 C-9|JE with TC approval, EN

:::note
To begin performing an SCP Demonstration Interview, it is to first ensure that you have the following individuals ready at Site Epsilon/Clean Rooms or already are with you.
- Class-Ds, along with their SD escorts [Refer to the table above]
- Additional escorts required [Refer to the table above]
:::

- **STEP 1:** Head to the containment cell of the SCP on which you wish to perform an SCP Demonstration Interview on.

- **STEP 2:** Upon arrival at the SCPs containment, the next step would be to perform a basic interview.
> The questions you are to be asking during the interview should be related to the infrastructure or furnishing within the containment cell they are designated.

- **STEP 3:** The next step in performing SCP Demonstration Interviews may be seen in the table below.

|SCP|SCP Demonstration|
|-------|-------|
|SCP-999|If a Class-D/s is/are present:
- Instruct the Class-D/s to play with SCP-999 for approximately 3 minutes.|
