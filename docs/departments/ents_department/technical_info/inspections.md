Inspections are performed to improve both the design and efficiency of an area, along with repairing any current flaws observed. Engineering personnel may perform inspections on any area within the installation, albeit certain areas require you to be at a certain rank in the department, have an escort or approval from certain individuals before starting your inspection.

- **STEP 1:** The first step in creating an inspection would be to first decide on an area you want to inspect. When performing your first inspection, it is ideal that you inspect an area that isn’t too big or too small. An example of an ideal location to inspect would be the Omicron Gym.

- **STEP 2:** Now that you have decided upon an area on which you want to perform an inspection on, identify if that area requires you to first obtain the approval of certain individuals, or if you require escorts to be within the area.
> If it does, then it is important that you contact the individuals which you need to acquire their permission or coordinate with members of the MTF or SD who will be acting as escorts before heading to the area you wish to inspect. More information regarding the aforementioned topic will be discussed later on in this document.

> If the area you plan on inspecting doesn’t require you to acquire approval from certain individual/s or if you aren’t required to have an escort when within the area, then you may begin making your way to the area in which you will be inspecting.

- **STEP 3:** Upon arrival at the area, begin by conducting a general overview of the area of focus. For this part, it is recommended that you note down the purpose, ambience, colour, size, shape and features of the room. You may write down additional information which you deem is fit for this section as well.

- **STEP 4:** Once finished with writing down a description of an area, approach one of the objects within the room you are inspecting [Examples are couches, tables, windows and lighting fixtures], take a picture of it, then begin describing the object with a great amount of detail. For this part, you may include the texture, the colour, the purpose, the shape and other essential information about the object.
> Repeat this step until you have described every aspect of the area you are inspecting.

- **STEP 5:** The next step would be to figure out possible issues you believe may be faced in a certain scenario, or already is a big issue itself regardless of the scenario within the area you are inspecting. After you have figured out these possible issues, explain in your document why they may become an issue that may hinder or make Foundation operations less efficient in detail.
 These problems may range from vending machines placed at areas that may serve as a hindrance to containment efforts during a containment breach, to the way in which the shape of a room, along with the placement of furnishing within it is placed in areas that would give hostile personnel within the area advantage in a fight.

- **STEP 6:** After figuring out what problems there are with the area of inspection, your next goal would be to find solutions that can combat said problems. Ensure that you describe these solutions in great detail. It is advised that you provide 4-8 suggestions that relate to the problems noted.

- **STEP 7:** [OPTIONAL] You may opt to interview an individual to gather their suggestions and opinions on the area you were previously inspecting. More information regarding interviews will be discussed later on in this document.

- Engineering personnel may request for a maximum amount of 2 Class-Ds when performing an inspection on Subject-8871 and SCP-610’s containment. If you opt to utilize Class-Ds, ask them to enter the containment of any of the SCP or entities mentioned above, then ask them to provide a description of what the area looks like.

- Engineering personnel may enter the containment of the SCP if permitted by any Crimson-9 escort.
> You are, however, not permitted to enter the inner-containment of SCP-610, Subject-8871 and Subject-0666.

- Engineering personnel may attach an interview log with SCP-999, SCP-368, SCP-131, SCP-1048, SCP-082, SCP-049, SCP-457 and Subject-0001 to your inspection to gain extra promotion credits. [More information regarding interviews will be discussed later on in this document]

:::caution
Engineering personnel are to abide by the following regulations when performing an inspection. A Class-C punishment may be administered to those who fail to follow the set regulations when performing an inspection.
:::

Engineering personnel planning on performing an inspection on an area in which members of a department spawn in [Ethics Committee Office, Medical Bay, MTF Spawn] are to first acquire permission from any member of the medium command team of the department who spawns there. You may inspect the FP spawn without permission.

Before inspecting the Phi or Installation Command checkpoint, you will need to first acquire permission from any member of the Military Police medium command team. If you plan on inspecting the Site Alpha or Site Epsilon checkpoint, you are to ask for permission from any member of the Crimson-9 command team.

:::note
Inspections are not to be performed anywhere within the Class-D Containment itself. [This does not include the CDC Observation Areas]
:::

:::info
Inspections are graded based on how detailed you described the area, the suggestions you have provided, and the uniqueness of the suggestions and observations you have provided. The highest grade you can get in all categories is Excellence, while the lowest grade you can get is unsatisfactory.
:::

|Grade|Detail|Suggestions|Creativity|
|-------|------------|-----------|----------|
|Excellence|The inspection was written with a great amount of detail.  A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the problems observed during the inspection, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was provided and written with a great amount of detail.|Suggestions explicitly address issues that have been identified. At least half of the ideas deliver a significant advantage without radically affecting the Foundation's operations or imposing negative consequences.|At least 2 new unique observations that were never observed by anyone else were included in the document. The suggestions/solutions provided were all unique.|
|Well Done|The inspection was written with a good amount of detail.  A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the problems observed during the inspection, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was provided and written with a good amount of detail.|At least half of the ideas explicitly address concerns that have already been written within the same document. At least half of the solutions deliver significant advantages without putting a significant strain on the Foundation's operations. The alternative methods either bring benefits that aren't very significant, or they have drawbacks.|Most observations included within the document were unique, with 2 being mentioned rarely. The suggestions/solutions provided may have been mentioned before, however, it doesn’t fall within the common category.|
|Satisfactory|The inspection was written with a vague amount of detail.  A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the problems observed during the inspection, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was provided and written with a vague amount of detail.|At least one suggestion explicitly resolves a problem that has been reported in the same document or report as the first one. Although at least one of the recommendations has moderate to high advantages, it also has some big negatives. Solutions and ideas are presented in a manner that is consistent with E&TS's operations. Suggestions were described with a vague amount of detail.|Some observations included within the document were common. At least 1 observation was considered to be unique. The suggestions/solutions provided may have been mentioned before, and are considered to be somewhat common.|
|Needs Improvement|The inspection was written with a vague amount of detail.  A summary paragraph containing all issues observed based on the problems observed during the inspection, along with solutions to face the mentioned issues was not provided.|None of the solutions directly address a problem that has been identified in the paper. The solutions either do not give any benefits or have severe disadvantages.|None of the observations recorded was unique. The suggestions/solutions provided may have been mentioned before, and are considered to be common.|
|Unsatisfactory|Does not fit into any of the categories above.|Does not fit into any of the categories above.|Does not fit into any of the categories above.|

Each of those category grades [Excellence, Well, Done, Satisfactory, etc.] are worth points to help in calculating your overall grade.

|Category Grade|Points Worth|
|-------|-------|
|Excellence|5 Points|
|Well Done|3 Points|
|Satisfactory|2 Points|
|Needs Improvement|1 Point|
|Unsatisfactory|0 Points|
