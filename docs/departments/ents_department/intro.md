Welcome to the Engineering & Technical Services Department! We are glad to have you here! This document contains all vital information pertaining to Engineering and Technical Services, the activities you are entitled to, and the responsibilities you undertake.

The Engineering and Technical Services is a minor department within the Foundation, responsible for maintaining the general welfare of the foundation, through the use of innovative ideas, observant minds, and spontaneous thinking. They have authority over a multitude of aspects of the foundation, including but not limited to generators, turbines, and other dysfunctional appliances. The primary object within the foundation that E&TS is responsible for is the Dark Matter Reactor, ensuring all power reaches the facility's sites, in a stable and safe manner. The department’s primary directive is to uphold the quality of the site’s infrastructure by operating and swiftly fixing areas around the facility. Thus, the department is an essential pillar for on-site operations to continue working.

E&Ts is also responsible for the execution of controlled breaches to understand the capabilities of certain SCPs if they were to ever breach. It's the Engineering and Technical services job to make solutions from said controlled breaches.

Due to the complex nature of this department, this document has been composed to aid you in fully understanding the usage of your equipment, along with how to perform your given duties throughout the site.

With all of that out of the way, welcome to E&TS.
