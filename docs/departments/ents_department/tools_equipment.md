| ![Wrench](images/wrench.png "Wrench")                 | A wrench is a tool that engineering personnel may use to repair broken windows. To repair a broken window, approach it, and hold the key shown on the proximity prompt. 

Windows may not be repaired 15 seconds prior to it being destroyed unless all rogue Class-Ds within the area have been terminated by any combative personnel before the end of the given timeframe.

As of 1/2022, wrenches are not capable of repairing broken windows.
