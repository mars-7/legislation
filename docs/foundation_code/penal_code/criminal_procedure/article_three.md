<h3 id="FC2.3">2 F.C. § 3 - Standards of Evidence</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Varying standards of proof exist that allow authorities to make certain decision and which determine what authorities are permitted to admit as proof, as listed below</li>
	<li>Reasonable Suspicion determines that an authority, agency or service entrusted with the upholding of law has basis to believe an offense has been committed but does not have evidence that can directly prove such an offense occured. Reasonable Suspicion permits the instigation of further and more invasive inquiry however is not admissable in any official forum and is to be dismissed if presented, unless it is in support of articles which are of a higher standard of evidence.</li>

		<li>An individual can not have any sanction levied against them on the basis of <a href="https://legislation.scpf.io/foundation_code/penal_code/criminal_procedure/article_three">2 F.C. § 3(2)</a></li>
		<li>An individual may be detained for no more than 2 hours on this basis</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Probable Cause determines that there is fixed evidence that supports the hypothesis to the point where any man on the Clapham omnibus would determine that an offense had been commited, prompting further inquiry. Reasonable Suspicion is not admissable as a sole incident of evidence in an official forum but allows far more longevity in the time of inquiry and freedom in what action may be undertaken, with the capacity for temporary constraints to be applied existing;</li>
	<ol style={{'list-style' : 'lower-alpha'}}>
		<li>An individual held under probable cause may be detained for 24 hours as a Class E</li>
		<ol style={{'list-style' : 'lower-roman'}}>
			<li>If no charge is made within the 24 hour period, the individual is to be released and their record cleared</li>
			<li>The authority is to report all releases without charge to the Internal Review Service, with improper action warranting possible inquiry</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<li>Preponderance of the evidence is an admissable form of evidence in an official forum that determines an individual must providng evidence which holds a great level of determination and persuasion than that of the other party; if such persuades those hosting the official forum, it may be used to instigate further proceeding or in rare case charge the individual;</li>
	<ol style={{'list-style' : 'lower-alpha'}}>
		<li>An individual must provision actual evidence and may not employ disinformation or heresay; provisioning such in an official forum is contempt of an official forum</li>
		<li><a href="https://legislation.scpf.io/foundation_code/penal_code/criminal_procedure/article_three">2 F.C. § 3(4)</a> constitutes satisfactory evidence in minor cases, such as the debating of an internalized suspension order</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Clear and convincing evidence indicates articles that have a higher probability of holding than truth than being untruthful, with the contention having an obligation to prove that it is far more probable to be true than it is to be untrue. </li>
	<ol style={{'list-style' : 'lower-alpha'}}>
		<li><a href="https://legislation.scpf.io/foundation_code/penal_code/criminal_procedure/article_three">2 F.C. § 3(5)</a> constitutes satisfacory evidence in all forums however is to be dismissed if <a href="https://legislation.scpf.io/foundation_code/penal_code/criminal_procedure/article_three">2 F.C. § 3(6)</a> disproves it</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Evidence of a reasonable doubt is the highest standardization of evidence within the general organizations jurisprudence and mandates that evidence must, to any reasonable party, present the accused as guilty beyond any degree of reasonable doubt, and henceforth must be based upon objective findings and not substantial action and henceforth overcoming the prerequisite that a person shall be treated as an innocent, as such proves their guilt.</li>
	<ol style={{'list-style' : 'lower-alpha'}}>
		<li><a href="https://legislation.scpf.io/foundation_code/penal_code/criminal_procedure/article_three">2 F.C. § 3(6)</a> is the highest mandated standard of evidence and can only be dismissed in an official forum by an equal article of higher providence in its capacity to disprove.</li>
	</ol>
