<ol>
	<li>Exceeding the Speed Limit is defined as a vehicle's Studs Per Second (SPS) exceeding the set speed limit in SPS for that road</li>
	<li>If there is no posted speed limit:</li>
	<ol style={{'list-style' : 'lower-alpha'}}>
		<li>on a highway, the speed limit is 60 SPS</li>
		<li>at or approaching a checkpoint, the speed limit is 35 SPS</li>
		<li>within Site Epsilon, the speed limit is 35 SPS</li>
		<li>within Site Omicron, the speed limit is 25 SPS</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Exceeding the speed limit is acceptable should there be a situation of urgency. What is considered a "situation of urgency" is a situation that requires a timely response otherwise it suffers severe consequences, at the discretion of a Traffic Constable.</li>
