### Contents

Incorporated FLC contents are maintained by representatives of the Legislation Office, which is accountable directly to Overwatch Command and its authorized, public representatives. The FLC, unlike the Supreme Guidelines,  is not designed as an information packet for mass-publication and is instead tailored as a central datastore for all legal procedures and acts applicable to the general organization,  however excersises an equal level of providence over afformentioned personnel as the Supreme Guidelines bar occasions where they contradict, wherein the Foundations Legal Code take absolute providence; this may be nullified  or  ratified by any member of the Overseer Council, who are not held accountable to the FLC outside of directives imposed by The Administrator ("O5-1").
