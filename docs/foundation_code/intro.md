### Contents

The Foundations Legal Code ("FLC") is the Special Containment Procedures Foundation (hereon "General Organization") is a central compendium for all legal articles, mandates, directives and orders applicable to large groups of general organization members, namely Class D Personnel and Foundation Personnel. The FLC therefore does not directly contain publicized or classified departmental or incorporated entity regulation bar specific circumstances such as specific-site ordinance but still excersises providence over these guidelines and includes them as unincorporated components of legislature, presuming afformentioned regulation has been upholded by a representative of the Overseer Council or an authorized member of Senior Command.

Incorporated FLC contents are maintained by representatives of the Legislation Office, which is accountable directly to Overwatch Command and its authorized, public representatives. The FLC, unlike the Supreme Guidelines,  is not designed as an information packet for mass-publication and is instead tailored as a central datastore for all legal procedures and acts applicable to the general organization,  however excersises absolute providence over afformentioned personnel, with the Supreme Guidelines serving purely as a compendium of basic information for general users and, through such median, holds no actual legal basis outside of the provision of information for general consumption. The FLC and the statutory ordinances subordinate to it, such as departmental authorized guidelines, are absolute in their providence over general organization staff, bar those with a defined exemption - namely the Overseer Council.
